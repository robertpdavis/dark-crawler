## Description

Dark Crawler is a full stack application that offers a fully functioning board game, with randomized encounters and rewards, each play through will be different and offers incredible amounts of replay value for our users. Given a user is logged-in, they are able to select a character and start a new game, or can continue/resume to play the game from where they left.

This application is inspired by early dungeons and dragons style tabletop gaming, our team has come together to offer users the ability to enjoy the greatest excitements of obtaining loot and surviving dangerous encounters in a web application environment. It was made as part of the group project to learn about full-stack applications created with Model-View-Controller.

Dark Crawker application is following the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, and uses uses various npm packages such as, `express-handlebars` as the templating language, `express`, `dotenv`, ` bcrypt` and `express-session` npm packages for authentication, `sequelize`, `connection-session-sequelize` as the ORM, `mysql2` for the back-end. It was build completely from scratch and deployed to Heroku.
